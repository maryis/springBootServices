this project has one main endpoints: /cars/x
that is created automatically by  @RepositoryRestResource
------------------------Lombok----------------------

@Getter @Setter @NoArgsConstructor

only get the data when the corresponding getter is called the first time. This is called lazy-loading:
@Getter(lazy = true)
    private final Map<String, Long> transactions = readTxnsFromFile();

@Builder
ApiClientConfiguration.builder()
        .host("api.server.com")
        .port(443)        
    .build();
    
@Slf4j // or: @Log @CommonsLog @Log4j @Log4j2 @XSlf4j
and in class: log.info()

 @Synchronized : annotate your methods (both instance and static) with it and you'll get an autogenerated private,
  unexposed field your implementation will use for locking(better than classic synchronized)
  
By delombok-ing your code you'd get autogenerated Java source code with exactly the same features from the bytecode Lombok built.
